Description

    We want you to calculate the sum of squares of given integers, excluding any negatives.
    The first line of the input will be an integer N (1 <= N <= 100), indicating the number of test cases to follow.
    Each of the test cases will consist of a line with an integer X (0 < X <= 100), followed by another line consisting of X number of space-separated integers Yn (-100 <= Yn <= 100).
    For each test case, calculate the sum of squares of the integers, excluding any negatives, and print the calculated sum in the output.
    Note: Do not put blank lines between test cases solutions.
    Note 2: Take input from standard input, and output to standard output
